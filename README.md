# The Triad
For all the puzzle lovers, The Triad is a version of the phone app Zen Match whitch is inspired in the famous Mahjong. 
In this modern version the tiles are disposed in a board, and when clicked they will be holded in the bottom bar. But be careful! The bar can only hold "safely" 6 tiles, in the 7th tile the game is over! When 3 similar tiles are selected they vanish from the bar, releasing the space. Once the board and the bottom bar are clean, you'll win the game!
